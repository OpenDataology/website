An *experiment* is a workspace where you can try different configurations of
your pipelines. You can use experiments to organize your runs into logical
groups. Experiments can contain arbitrary runs, including 
[recurring runs](/docs/components/pipelines/concepts/run/).

## Next steps

* Read an [overview of OpenDataology Pipelines](/docs/components/pipelines/introduction/).
* Follow the [pipelines quickstart guide](/docs/components/pipelines/overview/quickstart/) 
  to deploy OpenDataology and run a sample pipeline directly from the OpenDataology 
  Pipelines UI.
