# OpenDataology Website

Welcome to the GitHub repository for OpenDataology's public website!

The website is hosted at https://www.opendataology.com.

We use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [google/docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy)
theme for styling and site structure, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to manage the deployment of the site.

## Quickstart

Here's a quick guide to updating the docs:

1. Fork the [OpenDataology/website repository](https://github.com/OpenDataology/website) on GitHub.

2. Make your changes and send a pull request (PR).

3. If you're not yet ready for a review, add "WIP" to the PR name to indicate it's a work in progress. 

4. Wait for the automated PR workflow to do some checks. 
   When it's ready, you should see a comment like this: `deploy/netlify â€” Deploy preview ready!`

5. Click **Details** to the right of "Deploy preview ready" to see a preview of your updates.

6. Continue updating your doc and pushing your changes until you're happy with the content.

7. When you're ready for a review, add a comment to the PR, remove any holds or "WIP" markers, and assign a reviewer/approver. 
   See the [OpenDataology contributor guide](https://github.com/OpenDataology/OpenDataology/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
